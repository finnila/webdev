    <p>
      Leo is our majestic male lion who has been with us for 5 years. Lions are
      known as the "King of the Jungle" despite actually living in grasslands
      and savannas. Male lions like Leo can weigh up to 550 pounds and are
      recognizable by their distinctive manes.

      Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides. They are
      excellent hunters and can run at speeds of up to 50 mph for short
      distances. Leo enjoys lounging in the sun and is most active during
      feeding time.
