    <p>
      Percy is our playful Emperor penguin who came to us from Antarctica.
      Emperor penguins are the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin
      species. Percy stands about 4 feet tall and is an excellent swimmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the wild, Emperor penguins can dive up to 1800 feet deep and hold their
      breath for up to 20 minutes! Percy loves to show off his swimming skills
      during feeding time and enjoys sliding on his belly during our daily
      penguin parades.
