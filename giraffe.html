    <p>
      Grace is our tallest resident, standing at an impressive 16 feet tall! She
      is a Masai giraffe, characterized by her distinctive pattern of dark
      brown, angular patches. Grace has been with us since she was young and has
      grown into a beautiful adult giraffe.

      Giraffes like Grace have incredibly long tongues (up to 50 cm!) that help
      them reach leaves high up in trees. Their unique pattern of spots helps
      them camouflage in the wild. Grace enjoys eating acacia leaves and
      participating in our daily giraffe feeding sessions where visitors can
      feed her special giraffe treats.
