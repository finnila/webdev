    <p>
      Emma is our gentle African elephant who loves playing with water. African
      elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. Emma weighs around 7,000
      pounds and continues to grow! She is incredibly intelligent and has
      learned to perform several behaviors that help our veterinarians check her
      health.

      Elephants are known for their excellent memory and complex social
      relationships. Emma spends her days eating (up to 300 pounds of food per
      day!), playing with enrichment toys, and taking mud baths to keep cool.
